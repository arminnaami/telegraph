Telegraph is a parser of script files for Titanic, a visual novel game engine.

This project is _super_ WIP right now. It has basic parsing functionality of script files, but can't be used to actually create a game.

# Installation

Telegraph is written in JavaScript. An NPM installation is required to build and test the source code.
